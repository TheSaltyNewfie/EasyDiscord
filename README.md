- The project is no longer called EasyDiscord and is now called EasyPython because of the following changes that are soon to come
    - EasyJson: a module that will make it easier and simpler to handle json files in python and is compatible with EasyDiscord and Discord.py
- Over time, more and more modules will be added as I create them
