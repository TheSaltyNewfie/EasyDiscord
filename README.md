# EasyDiscord
This is a module for python that has definitions in it to help people code a Discord bot within python.
# Who can use this?
Anyone can! This module is meant for people who are new to python or the Discord API itself and for people who are
experienced and just want to make their code more pretty.
# Why did you make this module?
I wanted to rewrite my current bot and have less lines to make it more.
understandable and I thought it would be good to release to the public.

# Update: 6/17/2021
This update adds a few new features such as a GUI.
**The GUI should not be used right now as it blocks the console.**

I have also added a feature to log messages.
